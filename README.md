# LifeHack22_SeedLings_IGoGreen
Recycling tracker app built using React and Firebase 

Problem Statement: In 2021, the NEA lamented that Singaporeâ€™s recycling rate had fallen to a 10 year low. What can we do to encourage more people to recycle, or make recycling more convenient and accessible?

Aim of our web application: Encourage more people to recycle 

Proposal: Our web app, iGoGreen, allows users to input their recycling tally for the day, accumulating points on the way.  Upon reaching certain benchmarks, they are eligible to claim rewards, as a form of incentive. 

Stack: React

Features: 
Main page with Dashboard and responsive Navbar
The main page consists a counter tally for each type of recyclable and it can be submitted to be authorised. Once authorised, it will show up at the bottom as part of the history for the month. The amount will also be translated into points. 
Rewards Page
Has a list of different partners/sponsors who offer incentives that can be exchanged for using the points accumulated 
Table with counter of amount recycled

We have implemented a simple responsive,front end, proof-of-concept where dummy functionalities are simulated to show their purpose.
This is our first time working with React and it was achieved in 24 hours.
